# NLP Twitter Sentiment Analysis

# Summary
The purpose of this project was to create an NLP model that would predict the sentiment of a tweet and classify it as either positive or negative.  The model was trained on a set of tweets pulled from kaggle that already had scores associated with them.  This model was then used to predict if a collection of tweets about NVIDIA were either positive or negative.  

The model, sentiment predictions, and model accuracy scores can be found in the [sentiment-challenge.ipynb](../NLP_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis/Code/sentiment-challenge.ipynb) file.

The data used in the code can be found in the following locations:
- [Training Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)
- [Big Tech Twitter Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wjia26/big-tech-companies-tweet-sentiment)
